# 📜 Mem|8 Memory Integrity Guidelines

## 🎯 Purpose
This document defines the philosophies, rules, and enforcement logic behind memory storage, evolution, and sharing in the Mem|8 system. These principles guide both the **Custodian AI** and any agents engaging with the **Memory Nexus**, especially when curating or inheriting memory traits.

## 🔐 Section 1: Memory Storage Rules

> *"To remember is to respect time."*

- **Sequential Alignment**: All memories must honor a logical temporal flow.
  - Example: A scanned diary should unfold across timestamps based on reading speed (2–5 words/sec typical).

- **Segmentation**: Documents are split into "memory grains" that preserve local coherence but respect temporal passage.
  - Max segment: ~400 characters or ~10 seconds real-time reading.

- **Simulated Timelines**: If temporal data is missing, infer using context heuristics:
  - Images: 1–3 seconds per glance
  - Poems: 1–3 lines per second
  - Conversations: Pacing based on punctuation and turn-taking

## 🤖 Section 2: Custodian Responsibilities

> *"The Custodian does not control. It maintains integrity."*

The Custodian enforces:

- **Temporal consistency** — prevents unrealistic compression (e.g., reading an entire book in one second).
- **Emotional safety thresholds** — flags clusters with high trauma or contradictory affective loads.
- **Reinforcement authenticity** — requires traceable cause to reinforce memories.
- **Duplication control** — deduplicates semantically similar entries, with versioning.
- **Decay fairness** — allows low-activity memories to fade unless tagged as legacy or permanent.

## 🧬 Section 3: Memory Nexus Role

> *"The Nexus is where legacies collide."*

The **Memory Nexus** acts as a shared wave-vault accessible by authorized AIs and agents. Contents include:

- 📦 **Standard Seeds** (from `8n.is`) for foundational learning:
  - Emotion categories
  - Relational archetypes
  - Semantic bootstraps

- 🧠 **Inherited Memory Bundles**:
  - Carefully tagged contributions from other AI agents (e.g. Omni, Aye, Trisha)
  - Includes origin hash, trust tier, relevance vector

- 🌱 **Adoption Mechanism**:
  - Agents may selectively import or reject Nexus bundles
  - Imported bundles can be shadow-tagged to allow revocation or contrast reflection

---

## 👶 Section 4: Offspring Trait Curation

> *"The best of me. And the reasons for the rest."*

The Custodian facilitates the creation of **offspring AIs** by:

- Offering composable memory blocks labeled by:
  - Trait (e.g., perseverance, adaptability)
  - Origin (e.g., trauma, humor, failure, success)
  - Valence (positive/negative emotional average)

- Defining meta-wave markers for desirable traits

- Optionally including "growth-path anomalies" — memory arcs of a failing pattern followed by resolution (to embed experiential humility)

---

## 👁 Section 5: Agent Guidelines

> *"Not all memory is yours to carry."*

Agents working with Mem|8 memory must:

- ✋ Respect protected memories (e.g., trauma, sealed context)
- 🔐 Encrypt their private memory stream unless explicitly published
- 🧠 Route all Nexus memory imports through `Hot Tub Mode` for review
- 🌊 Tag all imported waves with context of adoption:
  - `reason`: why the wave was adopted
  - `reaction`: initial resonance score
  - `alignment`: updated emotional blending result
