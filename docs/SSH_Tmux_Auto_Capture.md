# Automatic SSH + Tmux Memory Capture

Seamlessly capture terminal sessions as wave memories just by SSH-ing into AyeOS.

## Overview

This feature automatically starts tmux with the Mem8 context watcher whenever someone connects via SSH. Every command, output, and interaction becomes a wave memory without any manual setup.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and start the container
cd ayeos
./test-mem8-ssh.sh

# SSH into AyeOS (from another terminal)
ssh -p 2222 ayeos@localhost  # password: ayeos

# That's it! You're now capturing memories automatically
```

## How It Works

1. **SSH Connection**: When you SSH into AyeOS, it triggers `ssh_tmux_wrapper.sh`
2. **Automatic Tmux**: The wrapper starts a tmux session with custom configuration
3. **Context Watcher**: A Python process monitors your terminal activity in the background
4. **Pattern Detection**: Important patterns (errors, commands, questions) are prioritized
5. **Wave Conversion**: Terminal context is converted to wave memories and stored

## Architecture

```
SSH Client â†’ SSH Server â†’ ssh_tmux_wrapper.sh â†’ tmux session
                                                       â†“
                                              tmux_context_watcher.py
                                                       â†“
                                              /tmp/mem8_tmux_*.json
                                                       â†“
                                                  Wave Memory
```

## Features

### Automatic Capture
- No manual setup required
- Starts capturing immediately on SSH login
- Runs silently in the background

### Smart Pattern Detection
| Pattern Type | Importance | Examples |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| Critical | 14-15 | error, crash, fatal, failed |
| Important | 11-12 | warning, bug, success, complete |
| Development | 9-10 | git, cargo, npm, make, docker |
| Questions | 8-9 | ?, how, what, why |
| Output | 7-8 | Compiling, Building, Running |

### Tmux Integration
- **Ctrl-w m**: View capture status
- **Ctrl-w M**: Manually capture current pane
- **Ctrl-w S**: Send pane to Mem8 (legacy)
- **Ctrl-w e**: Show emotional state

### Memory Management
- Captures every 10 seconds by default
- Stores last 100 lines of context
- Deduplicates identical captures
- JSON format for easy processing

## Commands Available

### Inside SSH Session
```bash
mem8-demo        # View captured memories and statistics
mem8-import      # Import memories into wave system
wave-status      # Check system emotional state
```

### From Host
```bash
# View captured memories
docker exec ayeos-mem8-test ls -la /tmp/mem8_tmux_*.json

# Monitor capture activity
docker exec ayeos-mem8-test tail -f /tmp/mem8_watcher.log

# Check emotional state
docker exec ayeos-mem8-test cat /tmp/ayeos/mood
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```yaml
MEM8_CAPTURE_INTERVAL: 10      # Seconds between captures
MEM8_CONTEXT_LINES: 100        # Lines of context to capture
AyeOS_MODE: collaborative     # Enable all features
```

### Docker Compose
```bash
# Start with docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose-mem8.yml up -d

# With full Mem8 server
docker-compose -f docker-compose-mem8.yml --profile full up -d
```

## Use Cases

### Development Sessions
Automatically captures:
- Compile errors with full context
- Git commits and their messages
- Test results and output
- Debug sessions

### Learning & Documentation
- Captures questions you ask
- Records solutions you find
- Preserves command sequences
- Builds knowledge base

### Collaborative Debugging
- Share terminal sessions as memories
- Replay debugging sequences
- Analyze patterns across sessions
- Build team knowledge

## Memory Structure

Each capture creates a JSON file:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-06T12:34:56Z",
  "context": "Last 500 chars of meaningful terminal output",
  "importance": 14,
  "category": "critical",
  "metadata": {
    "commands": ["cargo build", "git status"],
    "files": ["./src/main.rs", "./Cargo.toml"],
    "errors": ["error[E0599]: no method named 'foo' found"],
    "urls": ["https://docs.rs/example"]
  },
  "source": "tmux_watcher"
}
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Optimize Capture
- Adjust `MEM8_CAPTURE_INTERVAL` for your workflow
- Use manual capture (Ctrl-w M) for important moments
- Higher terminal activity = more memories

### Integration with Mem8
- Memories subject to temporal decay
- Cross-reference with other memory types
- Search using wave pattern matching
- Compressed to ~32 bytes per memory

### Performance
- Minimal overhead (<1% CPU)
- Captures stored as temporary JSON
- Batch import for efficiency
- Automatic cleanup of old captures

## Troubleshooting

### No Captures Appearing
```bash
# Check if watcher is running
docker exec ayeos-mem8-test pgrep -f tmux_context_watcher.py

# View watcher logs
docker exec ayeos-mem8-test cat /tmp/mem8_watcher.log
```

### SSH Connection Issues
```bash
# Check SSH service
docker exec ayeos-mem8-test ps aux | grep sshd

# View SSH logs
docker logs ayeos-mem8-test | grep SSH
```

### Tmux Not Starting
```bash
# Check wrapper script
docker exec ayeos-mem8-test cat /opt/ayeos/scripts/ssh_tmux_wrapper.sh

# Test manually
docker exec -it ayeos-mem8-test /opt/ayeos/scripts/ssh_tmux_wrapper.sh
```

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time wave conversion (no JSON intermediate)
- Multi-user session merging
- Emotional state from typing patterns
- Voice transcription integration
- GPU-accelerated pattern matching

## Summary

The SSH + Tmux automatic capture makes building wave memories effortless. Just SSH in and start working - every meaningful interaction becomes part of your permanent wave memory, ready to be recalled when needed. No setup, no configuration, just natural memory formation from your daily workflow.

ðŸŒŠ Happy memory building!
