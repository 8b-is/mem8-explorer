# Mem|8: Wave-Based Memory System Overview

## Core Concept

Mem|8 is a revolutionary memory system that uses wave-based patterns and grid structures to process, store, and adapt memories across multiple modalities. It combines temporal grids, emotional modeling, and predictive coding to create an adaptive and ethical memory framework.

## Key Components

### Grid-Based Memory Structure

- Type 0: Importance Grid [xxxx|yyyy|iiii|dddd] (position, importance, decay)
- Type 1: Temporal Links [16-bit temporal pointer]
- Type 2: Relational Links [16-bit relationship reference]
- Type 3: Language Context [tttt|dddddddddddd] (TTL, data)
- Type 4: Audio Context [tttt|dddddddddddd] (TTL, frequency data)
- Type 5: Visual Context [tttt|dddddddddddd] (TTL, pattern data)

### Memory Stages

1. Stage 1 (Surface): Immediate sensory input, like ripples on water
2. Stage 2 (Near Surface): Recent memories forming waves
3. Stage 3 (Deep): Long-term patterns stored as currents

### Memory Blanket

- Acts as a filter floating on the memory ocean
- Catches significant waves while letting unimportant ripples fade
- Adapts to what's important over time

## Core Features

### Wave Patterns

- Amplitude: Memory strength
- Frequency: How often memory repeats
- Phase: How memory aligns with others
- Decay: Natural fading rate

### Divergence Tracking

- Monitors deviations from expected patterns
- Flags anomalies and potential harmful influences
- Assigns divergence scores (0-255) to detect manipulation
- Enables self-correction and pattern validation

### Emotional Modeling

- Valence: -128 to 127 (negative to positive emotions)
- Arousal: 0 to 255 (intensity level)
- Priority-based recall for emotionally significant memories
- Dynamic adjustment of decay rates based on emotional weight
- Real-time emotional state visualization
- Supportive feedback mechanisms for collaborative work

### Memory Compression & Decay

Time Window | Resolution | Storage Format
------------|------------|---------------
0-1 hour    | 16-bit     | Full resolution
1-6 hours   | 14-bit     | High compression
6-12 hours  | 12-bit     | Medium compression
12-18 hours | 10-bit     | Low compression

### Importance-Based Storage

Level | Action
------|--------
15 (0xF) | Permanent storage
12-14 | Slow decay
8-11 | Normal decay
0-7 | Rapid decay
