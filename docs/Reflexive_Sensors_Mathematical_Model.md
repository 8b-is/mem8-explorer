# Mathematical Model of Reflexive Sensory Systems in Mem8

## Abstract

This document presents the mathematical framework underlying Mem8's reflexive sensor system - the FPGA-like circuits that trigger protective responses before conscious awareness. We derive the looming detection equations, multi-modal sensor fusion formulas, and wave interference patterns that enable sub-100ms reflexive responses.

## 1. Looming Detection Mathematics

### 1.1 Angular Size Expansion

When an object approaches an observer, its angular size θ(t) expands according to:

```
θ(t) = 2 × arctan(r / d(t))
```

Where:
- `r` = object radius (meters)
- `d(t)` = distance at time t (meters)
- `d(t) = d₀ - vt` for constant velocity v

### 1.2 Optical Expansion Rate

The rate of angular expansion (τ⁻¹) is the critical looming signal:

```
τ⁻¹ = (1/θ) × (dθ/dt) = v/d(t)
```

This gives us time-to-contact: `τ = d(t)/v`

### 1.3 Urgency Function

The reflexive urgency U(t) follows an exponential approach:

```
U(t) = 1 - e^(-λ/τ)
```

Where λ is the response threshold (typically 0.5-1.0 seconds).

### 1.4 Wave Pattern Encoding

In Mem8's wave system, looming creates a characteristic pattern:

```
Motion Wave:
  Amplitude: A_m(t) = U(t)
  Frequency: f_m(t) = f_base × (1 + k×U(t))
  Phase: φ_m(t) = ∫U(t)dt

Edge Detection Wave:
  Amplitude: A_e(t) = θ(t)/θ_max
  Frequency: f_e = 500 Hz (constant)
  Phase: φ_e(t) = π × sign(dθ/dt)
```

## 2. Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

### 2.1 Bayesian Sensor Integration

The probability of threat P(threat|sensors) combines multiple inputs:

```
P(threat|S₁,S₂,...,Sₙ) = P(threat) × ∏ᵢ P(Sᵢ|threat) / P(Sᵢ)
```

### 2.2 Wave Interference Pattern

When multiple sensors detect the same threat, their waves interfere:

```
Ψ_total = Σᵢ Aᵢ × e^(i(2πfᵢt + φᵢ))
```

The interference magnitude:

```
|Ψ_total|² = Σᵢ Aᵢ² + 2ΣᵢΣⱼ AᵢAⱼ cos(Δφᵢⱼ)
```

Where `Δφᵢⱼ = (2π(fᵢ-fⱼ)t + (φᵢ-φⱼ))`

### 2.3 Coherence Factor

Sensors detecting the same threat show phase coherence:

```
C = |Σᵢ Aᵢe^(iφᵢ)|² / Σᵢ Aᵢ²
```

C ≈ 1 indicates all sensors agree (high confidence)
C ≈ 0 indicates sensor disagreement (low confidence)

## 3. Reflexive Response Timing

### 3.1 Response Latency Model

Total response time T_response consists of:

```
T_response = T_sensor + T_circuit + T_motor
```

Where:
- `T_sensor` ≈ 10-20ms (photoreceptor/mechanoreceptor delay)
- `T_circuit` ≈ 20-50ms (neural circuit processing)
- `T_motor` ≈ 30-50ms (motor activation)

Total: 60-120ms typical reflexive response

### 3.2 Survival Margin

For successful avoidance:

```
T_impact - T_response > T_action
```

Where `T_action` is time needed to complete protective action (duck, blink, etc.)

## 4. Peripheral Vision Advantage

### 4.1 Rod Cell Distribution

Rod density ρ(θ) peaks at 20° eccentricity:

```
ρ(θ) = ρ_max × e^(-(θ-20)²/2σ²)
```

### 4.2 Motion Sensitivity Function

Peripheral motion sensitivity S(θ):

```
S(θ) = S_base × (1 + k×sin(θ))
```

Maximum at 60-90° (far periphery), explaining why we detect motion "from the corner of our eye."

## 5. Emotional Modulation

### 5.1 Anxiety Scaling

Reflex threshold T modulated by emotional state E:

```
T_effective = T_baseline × (1 - α×E_anxiety)
```

Where:
- `E_anxiety` ∈ [0,1] (anxiety level)
- `α` ≈ 0.5 (modulation strength)

### 5.2 Wave Amplitude Boost

Under stress, reflexive waves get amplified:

```
A_stressed = A_normal × (1 + β×E_arousal)
```

## 6. Implementation in Mem8

### 6.1 Circuit Activation Function

For each reflexive circuit:

```rust
activation = Σᵢ wᵢ × match_score(Sᵢ, input) × urgency(input)

if activation > threshold × sensitivity:
    trigger_reflex()
```

### 6.2 Wave Storage Pattern

Reflexive memories create high-energy wave packets:

```
Memory Wave:
  Amplitude: 0.9-1.0 (maximum)
  Frequency: 1000-5000 Hz (high urgency)
  Decay Rate: 0.01 (slow decay - survival value)
  Emotional Context: (valence: -100, arousal: 255, dominance: 20)
```

## 7. Example: Baseball Approaching Head

Given:
- Baseball radius: r = 0.037m
- Initial distance: d₀ = 10m
- Velocity: v = 30 m/s

Timeline:
```
t=0.00s: d=10.0m, θ=0.42°, τ=0.33s, U=0.86
t=0.10s: d=7.0m,  θ=0.61°, τ=0.23s, U=0.95
t=0.20s: d=4.0m,  θ=1.06°, τ=0.13s, U=0.99
t=0.25s: d=2.5m,  θ=1.70°, τ=0.08s, U=1.00 → REFLEX TRIGGERS
t=0.33s: d=0.0m,  IMPACT (avoided by ducking at t=0.35s)
```

The reflex at t=0.25s provides 80ms margin for protective action.

## Conclusion

The mathematical elegance of reflexive sensors lies in their simplicity: exponentially increasing urgency signals trigger threshold-based responses through coherent multi-modal wave interference. This FPGA-like architecture, operating at the speed of light through neural circuits, has kept organisms alive for millions of years - and now enhances Mem8's biologically-inspired memory system.
