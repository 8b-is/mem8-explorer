# Converter Integration in FileUploader

## Overview

The FileUploader has been successfully updated to integrate with the new ConverterRegistry system, providing seamless file conversion capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Changes

### 1. **ConverterRegistry Integration**
- Added `converter_registry` field to FileUploader
- Registry is initialized with all available converters (FFmpeg, Pandoc, ImageMagick, Text)
- Automatic converter selection based on file extensions

### 2. **Wave Generation**
- Integrated with existing `WaveGenerator` from the importer module
- Added specialized wave generation methods for different content types:
  - `text_to_waves()`: Chunks text and generates emotional context
  - `image_to_waves()`: Creates waves from image properties (brightness, contrast, hue)
  - `audio_to_waves()`: Samples audio and converts to wave patterns
  - `tabular_to_text()`: Converts spreadsheet data to text format

### 3. **Enhanced File Support**
- Native formats still use optimized parsers when available
- Unsupported formats automatically try conversion through registry
- Multiple converter fallback: text → image → audio

### 4. **Converter Flow**
```
1. Check if file has native support
2. If not, try text conversion first (most universal)
3. Fall back to image conversion (for graphics)
4. Fall back to audio conversion (for media)
5. Return error if no converter available
```

### 5. **Text Processing Improvements**
- All text-based formats now flow through `process_text_content()`
- Emotional analysis based on word sentiment
- Automatic chunking for large texts (1000 char chunks)
- HTML tag stripping for web content

## Usage Example

```rust
use mem8::upload::FileUploader;
use mem8::qdrant::emulator::QdrantEmulator;

let emulator = QdrantEmulator::new()?;
let mut uploader = FileUploader::new(emulator);

// Upload any supported file
let memory_ids = uploader.upload_file(Path::new("document.odt")).await?;

// The system will:
// 1. Detect .odt is not natively supported
// 2. Use Pandoc converter to convert to text
// 3. Generate wave patterns from text
// 4. Store in Mem8's wave-based memory
```

## Benefits

1. **Expanded Format Support**: Can now handle any format supported by converters
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back through multiple conversion options
3. **Preserved Performance**: Native formats still use optimized paths
4. **Unified Text Pipeline**: All text flows through same emotion/wave generation
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work unchanged

## Future Enhancements

1. Add converter quality options for lossy formats
2. Implement parallel conversion for multiple files
3. Add converter caching for repeated conversions
4. Support converter chaining (e.g., EPUB → HTML → Text)
5. Add metadata preservation through conversion pipeline
